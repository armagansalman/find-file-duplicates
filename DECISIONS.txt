The aim of this project is to find exact files under different paths as fast as possible. The project must provide capabilities to do multiple passes with increasing accuracy (find different files more accurately).

TODO(armaganslmn): File path list input method is a csv file. Every row's last string holds a path (directory or file).
TODO(armaganslmn): .csv that holds input paths has the character ';' as separator and '"' as quote character (the characters between single quotes).
TODO(armaganslmn): .csv that holds input paths is named input_paths.csv
TODO(armaganslmn): If directory path is given, list files recursively.
TODO(armaganslmn): Filter files with size lower than X before processing.
TODO(armaganslmn): Instead of making a list of all grouped paths after a pass, make a pass for every group individually???


NOTDO(armaganslmn): Add is_recursive and should_ignore options for PATHs.
NOTDO(armaganslmn): Add ignore path capability.
